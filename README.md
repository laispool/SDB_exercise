# Leveling exercises for satellite derived bathymetry on Google Earth Engine

#### A quick step by step tasks to complete the generation of a depth image on code editor:

* STEP 01: CREATE AREA OF INTEREST. <br />
Tip: to generate the file in GEE reading format, an option can be using the link: https://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0

* STEP 02: CONFIGURE THE TRAINING FILE TO IMPORT INTO GEE AS ASSET. PLOT THE POINTS ON THE MAP.<br />
Tip: The example file can be downloaded from this repository (for Babitonga Bay, SC, Brazil). Don't forget to check the coordinate system!

* STEP 03: SELECT AN IMAGE BY CHOOSING CLOUD COVERAGE, DATING AND CUTTING BY GEOMETRY FOR EACH MISSION (LANDSAT-5, LANDSAT-8, LANDSAT-9 AND SENTINEL-2). <br />
PLOT ALL ON THE MAP AND EXPORT ONE OF THE IMAGES TO GOOGLE DRIVE.<br />
Tip: To complete the export, take care of submitting tasks in the right panel.

* STEP 04: BUILD A COLLECTION BY CHOOSING CLOUD COVERAGE, CUT BY GEOMETRY AND ORGANIZE BY DATES FOR A MISSION OF YOUR CHOICE. PRINT THE COLLECTION ON THE CONSOLE GENERATED.<br />
Tip: There are different functions in GEE to crop single images and collections from geometry.

* STEP 05: REALIZING THAT FOR THE AREA OF INTEREST ARE TWO SENTINEL IMAGES REQUIRED, ASSEMBLE A MOSAIC.<br />
Tip: create image-type variables from the name (ID) of the images, then an image collection that will make up the mosaic.

* STEP 06: FROM THE GENERATED COLLECTION, APPLY NDWI TO THE ENTIRE COLLECTION.<br />
Repeat the previous step (NDWI) for a single, better quality image.

* STEP 07: MASK LAND VALUES FROM THE NDWI OF THE SINGLE IMAGE FROM THE PREVIOUS STEP, GENERATING NEW IMAGE. PLOT THE MASKED IMAGE ON THE MAP (WATER FEATURES ONLY).<br />
Tip: use the NDWI values to mask the original single image.

* STEP 08: FROM THE INDICATED CONSTANTS M0 = -96 AND M1 = 95, APPLY THE BATHYMETRIC INVERSION METHOD (STUMPF ET AL. 2003) ON THE ALREADY MASKED SELECTED IMAGE.<br />
Tip: follow the GEE code model below:
      &emsp; var m0… <br />
      &emsp; var m1… <br />
      &emsp; var nameFuncion = function (image) { <br />
      &emsp; &nbsp; var sdb = “write the STUMPF equation without the constants (m0 and m1) and rename” <br />
      &emsp; &nbsp; image = image.addBands(sdb); <br />
      &emsp; &nbsp; var depth = “re-write the equation applying the constants m0 and m1 and rename” <br />
      &emsp; &nbsp; return image.addBands(depth); <br />
      &emsp; }; <br />

* STEP 08: PLOT THE RESULT OF THE BATHYMETRIC INVERSION ON THE MAP AND EXPORT THE DEPTH LAYER/BAND TO GOOGLE DRIVE.<br />
Tip: select only the depth band created in the previous step (depth).

* STEP EXTRA: IN GIS SOFTWARE, INTERPOLATE THE BATHYMETERY VALUES FROM THE TRAINING FILE TO THE SAME RESOLUTION OF THE GENERATED IMAGE (DEPTH), USE THE INTERPOLATOR OF YOUR PREFERENCE.<br />
* STEP EXTRA: SUBTRACT THE TWO RASTER LAYERS (DEPTH WITH BATHYMETRIC INVERSION AND TRAINING FILE INTERPOLATION). PLOT THE DIFFERENCE MAP WITH COLOR BAR.
